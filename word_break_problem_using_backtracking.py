# Word Break Problem using Backtracking

# A recursive program to print all possible
# partitions of a given string into dictionary
# words

# A utility function to check whether a word
# is present in dictionary or not. An array of
# strings is used for dictionary. Using array
# of strings for dictionary is definitely not
# a good idea. We have used for simplicity of
# the program
def dictionaryContains(word):
	dictionary = {"mobile", "samsung", "sam", "sung", "man",
				"mango", "icecream", "and", "go", "i", "love", "ice", "cream"}
	return word in dictionary

# Prints all possible word breaks of given string
def wordBreak(string):

	# Last argument is prefix
	wordBreakUtil(string, len(string), "")

# Result store the current prefix with spaces
# between words
def wordBreakUtil(string, n, result):

	# Process all prefixes one by one
	for i in range(1, n + 1):
	
		# Extract substring from 0 to i in prefix
		prefix = string[:i]
		
		# If dictionary contains this prefix, then
		# we check for remaining string. Otherwise
		# we ignore this prefix (there is no else for
		# this if) and try next
		if dictionaryContains(prefix):
		
			# If no more elements are there, print it
			if i == n:

				# Add this element to previous prefix
				result += prefix
				print(result)
				return
			wordBreakUtil(string[i:], n - i, result+prefix+" ")

"""
Output
First Test:
i love ice cream and man go
i love ice cream and mango
i love icecream and man go
i love icecream and mango

Second Test:
i love sam sung mobile
i love samsung mobile
Complexities: 

Time Complexity: O(2n). Because there are 2n combinations in The Worst Case.
Auxiliary Space: O(n2). Because of the Recursive Stack of wordBreakUtil(â€¦) function in The Worst Case.

1. Word Break Problem using Backtracking (google)
Given a valid sentence without any spaces between the words and a dictionary of valid English words, find all possible ways to break the sentence into individual dictionary words.

Example 

Consider the following dictionary 
{ i, like, sam, sung, samsung, mobile, ice, 
  and, cream, icecream, man, go, mango}

Input: "ilikesamsungmobile"
Output: i like sam sung mobile
        i like samsung mobile

Input: "ilikeicecreamandmango"
Output: i like ice cream and man go
        i like ice cream and mango
        i like icecream and man go
        i like icecream and mango
